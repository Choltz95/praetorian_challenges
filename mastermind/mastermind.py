Implementation of relaxed and parallelized Knuth's Five Guess Algorithm[1]
to solve Praetorian's Mastermind Challenge[2]. The Algorithm works as follows:

1. Create the set S of all possible words of constant length k given an alphabet of length n.
2. Start with an initial random guess.
3. Evaluate the score of the guess.
4. Terminate if we have guessed the code.
5. Otherwise, remove from S any code that would not give the same response if it (the guess) were the code.
6. Apply the minimax search technique to find a next guess as follows.
7. Repeat from step 3 until the a score with the number of black pegs equal to the size of the word is obtained.

I relax this algorithm by introducing upper bounds to the number of computations the algorithm preforms on each loop of the program.
Parallelization is achieved with Python's Multiprocessing library against the pruning step. A solution can be found in rare cases for one core, but at least four provides reliable results.
Testing was done on a machine featuring an 8-core Intel i7 processor with 8 MB of Cache and 8 GB of RAM. Additional testing is scheduled on a node server with two processor chips,
each containing 14 cores, each of which has 2 hardware contexts (hyperthreads) - up to 56 threads in parallel.

Future work involves experimenting with alternate datastructures to represent the solution solution space, parallelizing more of the algorithm - ie generating the solution space, and
improving error handling and better printing + io.
